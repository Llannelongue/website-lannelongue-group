## About Cambridge

{% capture text %}

A good (independent) guide about relocating to Cambridge is [available on MoverDB](https://moverdb.com/moving-to-cambridge-uk/).

Cambridge is located around 55 miles north of London and has a population of ~180,000 people. Within Cambridge, most traffic is done by bike: the city is very flat and has the highest level of cycle use in the UK [apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20090605201526/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/CCI/SearchRes.asp?term=KS15&btnSubmit=Search)).

Transports: there are direct trains to London King's Cross (50min) and Stansted Airport is also nearby (30 miles and quick direct trains). __A new station, Cambridge South, is also expected to open ~100m from our office sometime in 2025!__

The BRC is at the centre of an immense amount of industry and academic activity. Ten minutes north is the Cambridge Station tech precinct which houses leading data science and AI companies, such as Microsoft Research, Amazon, Apple and Samsung AI. A short bus/cab ride south is the Wellcome Genome Campus, home to the Wellcome Sanger Institute, EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, Genomics England and others. A 45 minute train south is the London King's Cross tech precinct, which includes the Alan Turing Institute, Google's London Headquarters, DeepMind and the Francis Crick Institute.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge):
> Cambridge is at the heart of the high-technology Silicon Fen or Cambridge Cluster, which contains industries such as software and bioscience and many start-up companies born out of the university. Over 40 per cent of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. The Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, includes the headquarters of AstraZeneca and the relocated Royal Papworth Hospital.

> The city, like most of the UK, has a maritime climate highly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Located in the driest region of Britain, Cambridge's rainfall averages around 570 mm (22.44 in) per year, around half the national average. Owing to its low-lying, inland, and easterly position within the British Isles, summer temperatures tend to be somewhat higher than areas further west, and often rival or even exceed those recorded in the London area. Typically the temperature will reach 25.1 °C (77.2 °F) or higher on over 25 days of the year over the 1981–2010 period.
