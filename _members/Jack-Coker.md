Jack is a Research Associate in Green Computing. He works on developing and improving the methods and tools we use to assess the environment impact of scientific computing systems, from laptops to supercomputing clusters. In particular, he studies the power consumption, and associated carbon emissions, of the computing devices that have become indispensable to modern research and modern life. 

Jack has a background in computational physics and software engineering. His previous research, conducted during a PhD under the supervision of Professor Jenny Nelson at Imperial College London, was in the physics of organic semiconducting materials and their applications in renewable energy technologies. Following this, he worked as a software engineer in the Research Software Engineering and High-Performance Computing teams at Imperial. Prior to his PhD, he worked in the high-precision machining industry as a software engineer and completed an MPhys (hons) degree in Physics at the University of Sussex.
