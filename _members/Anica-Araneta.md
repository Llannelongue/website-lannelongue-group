Anica is our Project Coordinator and Community Manager. Originally from the Philippines, she holds a bachelor's degree in European Studies from Ateneo de Manila University, where she focused on International Relations and specialised in Hispanic Studies. A minor in sustainability sparked a shift in her academic and professional path, leading her to pursue an MSc in Sustainable Development (with Distinction) at the University of Sussex.

Her master's dissertation was on Decolonizing Innovation for Development, applying discourse analysis to critically examine and highlight coloniality in the National Innovation Systems (NIS) and economic development literature.

Before joining our team, Anica worked in the private sector as a Senior Project Manager and Data Strategy Consultant at a data science consulting firm in Southeast Asia. Her work centred on leveraging geospatial AI and machine learning for social impact and climate resilience, from mapping data ecosystems to generating open data for public use.

Aside from working in the intersections of sustainability and technology, Anica is also deeply interested in themes of social justice, decolonisation, and raising awareness for environmental and social issues in the Global South.
