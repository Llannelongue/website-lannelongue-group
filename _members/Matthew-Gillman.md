Matt is our Green Algorithms Software Engineer Lead.

Matt originally graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Physics with Astrophysics from the University of Leeds, but a few years later took a "conversion" MSc in Computer Science from the University of Hertfordshire. He also has a second MSc in Advanced Computer Science (with Distinction) from the University of Essex.

A lifelong learner, he has, additionally, a Graduate Certificate in Theology and a Postgraduate Certificate in Theology, both from the University of Chester by distance learning.

He has spent most of his career in software development, and has worked in a wide range of employers: Nortel Networks (then a global telecomms firm), the UK Home Office, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a number of London universities, an SME and even his own little company (now defunct). Over the years he has used C/C++, Perl, Python, Java, Matlab and Stata in various projects. He is an AFHEA (an Associate Fellow of Advance HE) and a certified Software Carpentry instructor.

Outside work, Matt enjoys reading (especially SF and thrillers), country walks, eating out, browsing in charity shops, and activities with his local church.
