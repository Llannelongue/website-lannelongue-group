Marty is Loïc's 7 yo Duck Tolling Retriever and indispensable home office co-worker.
Since joining the team in 2021, he takes his duties as research assistant extremely seriously and keeps a close (but often closed 💤) eye on manuscripts and grant applications. 
His research interests include bug-solving long walks and aerodynamics (of balls in particular).
