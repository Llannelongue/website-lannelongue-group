Newton is the latest addition to Loïc's team of research assistants/mascots; also a Duck Tolling Retriever, he joined the team in 2025.
Whilst not even a year old, he is compensating his lack of experience by unbounded enthusiasm.
Contrary to his namesake, he is still sometimes dumbfounded by gravity so, like a new student, he is still exploring different research topics. One thing is clear, the position of Senior Mascot is firmly in his sight.
