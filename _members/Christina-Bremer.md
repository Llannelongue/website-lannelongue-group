Christina is a Research Associate in Sustainable Research Practices (computational science), with experience across industry and academia. She is working on the Green Algorithms Initiative and, in particular, E-SCOUT, the Initiative’s multi-centre trial to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon reporting tools in reducing the environmental impacts of scientific computing.

Before moving to Cambridge, Christina completed her PhD and first postdoc in the Socio-Digital Sustainability group at Lancaster University. Supervised by Prof Bran Knowles and Prof Adrian Friday, her PhD research explored the energy-saving potential of digital behaviour change and efficiency interventions, taking into account technical factors, user behaviour, and rebound effects. After her PhD, she stayed in Lancaster to work on Net0Insights, a multidisciplinary project to design and develop data science tools that reduce commercial energy demand.

Initially, she received a BSc (Hons) Cognitive Science from the University of Edinburgh and an MSSc Human-Computer Interaction from Uppsala University.

Christina is a Postdoctoral Affiliate at Newnham College, University of Cambridge, an Associate Fellow of Advance HE, and a member of the Research Coordination Network on the Digital Economy and the Environment (RCN-DEE).
