Christina is a postdoctoral research associate in sustainable research practices (computational science), focusing on the Green Algorithms Initiative. Originally from near Hamburg, Germany, she completed a BSc (Hons) Cognitive Science at the University of Edinburgh and an MSSc Human-Computer Interaction at Uppsala University. With a keen interest in sustainable digitalisation, she then joined the Socio-Digital Sustainability group at Lancaster University for her PhD; supervised by Prof Bran Knowles and Prof Adrian Friday, her research explored the role of digital interventions in realising energy savings, taking into account base load, rebound effects and user behaviour. After her PhD, Christina stayed in Lancaster to work on Net0Insights, a multidisciplinary project that uses data science tools to reduce commercial energy demand, before moving to Cambridge. Alongside her academic research, she has worked as a UX designer and team lead in the sustainable energy/tech industry.
