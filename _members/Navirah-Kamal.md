Navirah Kamal is a Software Engineer with nearly three years of full-stack experience and a postgraduate degree in AI for Sustainable Development from University College London. Her work sits at the intersection of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and sustainability, with a focus on climate and environmental applications of technology.

Her master’s thesis investigated super-resolution of pan-Arctic melt pond imagery using diffusion models, leveraging SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data to improve remote sensing for environmental monitoring. While this work was driven by environmental objectives, it also prompted critical reflection on the carbon emissions and environmental cost of training machine learning models, shaping her broader interest in sustainable and responsible technology.

Prior to joining the team, Navirah worked as a full-stack software engineer, developing applications using Python, React, .NET, and Azure, with additional experience in machine learning, geospatial data, and remote sensing.
