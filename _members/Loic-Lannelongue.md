Loïc is an Assistant Research Professor in the Department where he leads the Cambridge Sustainable Computing Lab, a research group studying the environmental impacts of computing. Passionate about environmental sustainability and responsible science, he is involved in both research and policy internationally. He is a Software Sustainability Institute Fellow, a visiting scientist at the European Bioinformatic Institute (EMBL-EBI), and an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

He is also a Director of Studies in Computer Science and a Bye Fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge. 

He first studied in Paris (France) at Lycée Saint-Louis and ENSAE Paris where he earned a BSc and a French Diplôme d’Ingénieur (MSc) majoring in mathematics and statistics, with minors in theoretical physics and economics. He then earned an MSc in statistics and machine learning from the University of Oxford. He joined the department (in the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit) in 2018 for a PhD in Health Data Science supervised by Prof. Michael Inouye and supported by the MRC-DTP. His PhD, completed in 2022, looked at machine learning tools used to predict protein-protein interactions and the carbon footprint of computational research. From 2022 to December 2024, he continued in Cambridge as a Research Associate to pursue his work on Environmentally Sustainable Computational Science. He started his own research group in the same department at the start of 2025.

He is also interested in radiogenomics, i.e. combining medical imaging and genetic information with machine learning to better understand and treat cardiovascular diseases. This work is part of the [Cambridge Baker Systems Genomics Initiative](https://www.inouyelab.org/home) led by Prof. Michael Inouye.
