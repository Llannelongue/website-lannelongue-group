Melissa completed a BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry at the University of Manchester, where she developed a keen interest in bioinformatics and the genetics of human disease. After her bachelor’s degree, Melissa stayed at the University of Manchester to complete a PhD in statistical genetics investigating the genetic architecture of juvenile onset common complex diseases at the Centre for Genetics and Genomics Versus Arthritis. Melissa’s research focuses on the genetic susceptibility to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and how we can improve diagnosis and treatment by understanding the genetics of the disease. Alongside her research, Melissa gained her AFHEA (Associate Fellow of Advance HE).
