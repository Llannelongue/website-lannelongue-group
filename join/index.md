We are always happy to hear from talented researchers, with more specific current opportunities advertised below and on [Cambridge job portal](https://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk). More about Cambridge in the [About section](/about/#about-cambridge).

Prospective PhD students interested in doing a PhD with us should read about [postgraduates studies at Cambridge](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/). All admissions are through the [Department's PhD programme](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/cvphpdhpc) (don't worry about the title, this is just because of which department we're affiliated with). You are welcome to simply apply through the portal. If you want to discuss a potential PhD project with Loïc, you can email him directly with a CV and a summary of relevant experience and research interests that align with the group.

As a group, we value and encourage applications from a diversity of backgrounds and experiences to contribute to the highly interdisciplinary research programme. We strongly value and encourage Equity, Diversity and Inclusion as well as a flexible working environment.
