The role will be responsible for developing the team's software resources, including the next generation of carbon monitoring dashboards, and managing the existing Green Algorithms tools, ensuring they meet open-source and sustainable development best practices. In particular, the post holder's role will be to:

- Develop, disseminate and maintain the existing resources as well as support the design of new emerging tools related to the group's activities. Notably, the [Green Algorithms Dashboard for HPC](https://dashboard.green-algorithms.org/login) and the popular [online calculator](https://calculator.green-algorithms.org/), ensuring that they meet software engineering best practices.

- Develop both backend and frontend components of these tools, i.e. work on the architecture (e.g. databases, backend/frontend interface), user-interface (website, dashboard, API), and related software tooling.

- Work closely with the Project Leads to help scope, gather requirements for, and guide on technical choices and directions.

- Identify and implement opportunities to improve the performance, sustainability, and quality of the applications.

__Where?__ The group is based in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, one of Europe’s leading academic departments for population health sciences. It sits in the new Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart & Lung Research Institute on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus (Papworth Road, Trumpington, Cambridge CB2 0BB), with the option of hybrid working (full remote not possible unfortunately).

__With whom?__ You will be based in the Lannelongue group and work in close conjunction with the senior scientists in the Green Algorithms Initiative, including [Prof Michael Inouye](https://www.inouyelab.org/home/people). You will also work closely with other members of the Department and scientific collaborators based in other institutions.

__How long?__ The positions are for two years in the first instance, with the possibility of extension.

__How to apply?__ To submit an application for this vacancy, please click on the ‘Apply online’ section of the advertisement published on the University’s Job Opportunities pages (links for each advert above!).

### About the Green Algorithms Initiative
The Green Algorithms Initiative is a world-leading project in the field of green computing focusing on quantifying and reducing the environmental impacts of computational science. The tools and frameworks developed and maintained by the group are used internationally and include the popular Green Algorithms online calculator, server-specific monitoring tools and the GREENER Principles for Environmentally Sustainable Computational Science. The group has a strong commitment to making all tools available open access to the computing community. The Green Algorithms Initiative has received both nominations and awards for its contributions to environmentally sustainable research (e.g. HDR-UK Impact Award). More info on the [project's website](www.green-algorithms.org).
