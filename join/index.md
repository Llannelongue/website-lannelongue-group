The post will suit researchers interested in tackling one of the most pressing issues in tech today: improving our understanding and mitigating the environmental impacts of artificial intelligence and data centres. Your primary role will be to lead projects improving how computing environmental impacts are currently estimated and reported and investigate the impacts of high-impact computational tools in AI. The appointed researcher will have research interests aligned with those of our group and the freedom to develop their own ideas for new research. Initial possibilities for research projects include:

- Studying the environmental impacts of AI tools expected to become (or continue to be) prominent in research in the coming years.
- Taking a global view on the impacts of data centres and AI, encompassing environmental sustainability, human health, and perspectives from the Global South.
- Exploring ways to better integrate life-cycle analyses in impact estimates and expanding environmental impacts beyond carbon footprint, with a focus on water usage in particular.

__Where?__ The group is based in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, one of Europe’s leading academic departments for population health sciences. It sits in the new Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart & Lung Research Institute on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus (Papworth Road, Trumpington, Cambridge CB2 0BB), with the option of hybrid working (full remote not possible unfortunately).

__With whom?__ You will be based in the Lannelongue group and work in close conjunction with the senior scientists in the Green Algorithms Initiative, including [Prof Michael Inouye](https://www.inouyelab.org/home/people). You will also work closely with other members of the Department and scientific collaborators based in other institutions.

__How long?__ The positions are for two years in the first instance, with the possibility of extension.

__How to apply?__ To submit an application for this vacancy, please click on the ‘Apply online’ section of the advertisement published on the University’s Job Opportunities pages (links for each advert above!). This will route you to the University’s Web Recruitment System, where you will need to register an account (if you have not already) and log in before completing the online application form.
The covering letter should outline (1) why you are applying for this role, (2) how you match the criteria for the post, and (3) what research question(s) you would be interested in pursuing.

### About the Green Algorithms Initiative
The Green Algorithms Initiative is a world-leading project in the field of green computing focusing on quantifying and reducing the environmental impacts of computational science. The tools and frameworks developed and maintained by the group are used internationally and include the popular Green Algorithms online calculator, server-specific monitoring tools and the GREENER Principles for Environmentally Sustainable Computational Science. The group has a strong commitment to making all tools available open access to the computing community. The Green Algorithms Initiative has received both nominations and awards for its contributions to environmentally sustainable research (e.g. HDR-UK Impact Award). More info on the [project's website](www.green-algorithms.org).
